%Variable declaration:
R = 287; %Specific gas constant of air in J/(kg*k)
gamma = 1.4; %Specific heat ratio of air
Temp = [-56 15 -24 -56 17 -56]; %Vehicle's operating temperature in ‚Å∞C

Number = [1:1:6]; %When pritning the output each vehicle needs to be numbered so I created an array with the numbers.


%Equations to generate SoundSpeed and MachNumber
SoundSpeed = sqrt(R*gamma*TempK); %Scaler operation so no need for the dot operator.
MachNumber = VehicleSpeed./SoundSpeed; %Element-wise operation the dot operator is necenecessary.
